# A. thaliana Protein Structure Prediction Using AlphaFold

## Objective
The main aim is to use AlphaFold predictions to analyze a dataset of proteins from A. thaliana, aiming at a large-scale prediction and scoring process of non-synonymous protein variants.

## Description
This operation will involve the utilization of AlphaFold for the prediction of single-chain protein structures, rather than complex structures, for practical reasons. This approach simplifies calculations and eases the setup.

The process focuses on protein structures with a certain degree of completeness (e.g., 30% or 50% sequence consistency as per UniProt), avoiding the potential waste of resources on smaller fragments from larger proteins. 

Moreover, we propose sequence similarity cut-off (e.g., 99%) to reduce redundancies and elude multiple calculations for the same protein chain.

## Plan and Approach
1. Acquire the proper proteins: AlphaFold has a pre-computed structure database that should be used for the operation. Based on the information from PDB, we've found 830 proteins related to A. thaliana.

   1. Filter proteins that were made available on or after April 30, 2018, to ensure that they are not part of the AlphaFold's training set.

   2. Obtain single chain proteins over complexes to simplify the study.

   3. Choose proteins where the PDBs is a representation of a certain threshold of the entire protein, avoiding fragments.

   4. Eliminate any redundant protein chains with a sequence similarity cut-off.

2. Implement and run AlphaFold: Utilizing the acquired, filtered proteins as input, AlphaFold will then predict the protein structures.

3. Scoring and Analysis: Compare predicted structures with actual structures where they are available. Utilize the standard methods for comparing predicted and empirical structures.

The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of AlphaFold for protein-structure prediction specifically for A. thaliana proteins.  The output can be used for further research in the functional analysis for A. thaliana, or as a part of bioinformatic research on plant proteins. Overall, it will allow us to understand AlphaFold's performance when given a large-scale task on A. thaliana proteins, establishing a foundation for future research on similar topics.

## Milestones
1. Selection and download of relevant proteins from the pre computed AF2 database

2. Implementation of AlphaFold and generation of protein structure predictions

3. Comparison of predicted and actual structures to assess the success and reliability of AlphaFold predictions.

4. Comprehensive analysis and documentation of findings

With the plan and milestones clearly laid out, the prediction of the large-scale A. thaliana protein variants can be accomplished efficiently and in an organized manner.


# Protein Processing and Downloading Documentation

This Python script is designed for processing and downloading protein sequences and structures for the A. thaliana plant.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need:

- Python3
- Internet connection
- Access to uniprot and AlphaFold databases.
- Python's `requests` and `os` libraries

## Implementation

The script comprises two main Python classes: `A_thaliana_Protein` and `AF2_Structure`.

### Class 1: A_thaliana_Protein

This class is utilized to fetch protein sequences based on the protein's uniprot_id.

#### Methods

1. `__init__(self, uniprot_id)`: Initializes the protein object. The protein's sequence is downloaded upon object initialization by passing the uniprot_id.

2. `download_sequence(self)`: Downloads the protein's sequence from Uniprot and returns the sequence as a string. The URL is constructed using the input uniprot_id.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    protein = A_thaliana_Protein('YOUR_UNIPROT_ID')
    ```

### Class 2: AF2_Structure

This class is utilized to download protein structures corresponding to the PDB id.

#### Methods:

1. `__init__(self, pdb_id, download_dir)`: Initializes the structure object. The user must provide the `pdb_id` and the directory `download_dir` where the structure will be saved.

2. `download_structure(self)`: Downloads the protein structure and saves it in the directory defined during the object's initialization. The structure file will have the `.pdb` extension.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    structure = AF2_Structure('YOUR_PDB_ID', 'your_download_directory')
    structure.download_structure()
    ```

## Testing and Debugging

For testing and debugging purposes, you can utilize print statements or Python's built-in debugger, pdb.

This script may throw exceptions if the URLs constructed for downloading do not lead to valid resources. Therefore, ensure the uniprot_ids and pdb_ids provided are correct.
