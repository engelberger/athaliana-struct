# Protein Processing and Downloading Documentation

This Python script is designed for processing and downloading protein sequences and structures for the A. thaliana plant.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need:

- Python3
- Internet connection
- Access to uniprot and AlphaFold databases.
- Python's `requests` and `os` libraries

## Implementation

The script comprises two main Python classes: `A_thaliana_Protein` and `AF2_Structure`.

### Class 1: A_thaliana_Protein

This class is utilized to fetch protein sequences based on the protein's uniprot_id.

#### Methods

1. `__init__(self, uniprot_id)`: Initializes the protein object. The protein's sequence is downloaded upon object initialization by passing the uniprot_id.

2. `download_sequence(self)`: Downloads the protein's sequence from Uniprot and returns the sequence as a string. The URL is constructed using the input uniprot_id.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    protein = A_thaliana_Protein('YOUR_UNIPROT_ID')
    ```

### Class 2: AF2_Structure

This class is utilized to download protein structures corresponding to the PDB id.

#### Methods:

1. `__init__(self, pdb_id, download_dir)`: Initializes the structure object. The user must provide the `pdb_id` and the directory `download_dir` where the structure will be saved.

2. `download_structure(self)`: Downloads the protein structure and saves it in the directory defined during the object's initialization. The structure file will have the `.pdb` extension.

    Example usage:
    ```python
    structure = AF2_Structure('YOUR_PDB_ID', 'your_download_directory')
    structure.download_structure()
    ```

## Testing and Debugging

For testing and debugging purposes, you can utilize print statements or Python's built-in debugger, pdb.

This script may throw exceptions if the URLs constructed for downloading do not lead to valid resources. Therefore, ensure the uniprot_ids and pdb_ids provided are correct.
